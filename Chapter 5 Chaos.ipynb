    "We are investigating the behavior or the driven, damped pendulum (DPP), which is a non-linear DE.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, investigate how the behavior changes as drive strength increased.\n",
    "1. start wd=2*pi, w_0=1.5*wd, beta=w_0/4, and theta_0 and v_theta_0 = 0.\n",
    "2. Plot theta for gamma=0.2 for t from 0 to 10.  What's the period of the motion? Is this related to wd or w_0 or something else? What's the amplitude?  Sketch a picture on the whiteboard showing the range of motion of the pendulum.\n",
    "3. Plot theta for gamma=0.9 for t from 0 to 10.  What's the period of the motion? Is this related to wd or w_0 or something else? What's the amplitude?  Sketch a picture on the whiteboard showing the range of motion of the pendulum.  To see that the behavior is actualy different now, focus on one oscillation after t=5.  Add to the plot a proper sin function.  Adjust the amplitude so it matches that of the pendulum.  What to you conclude?\n",
    "4. Plot theta for gamma=1.06 for t from 0 to 15. Sketch a picture on the whiteboard showing the range of motion of the pendulum and describe its motion for t= 0 to 5.\n",
    "5. A useful technique for checking if a motion is periodic is to get the value of theta for a series of times separated by the period.  Create a funciton to do this.  It should take as inputs the theta data and the period and it should return an array of theta values.  Use your function to test the data for gamma=1.06 for times greater than 30.  What do you find?\n",
    "6. Plot theta for gamma=1.073 for t from 0 to 60. Interpret the motion of the pendulum.  Use the zoom tools to zoom in bottom of the oscillatory part of your graph.  Focus on times after t=30.  Describe what you see.\n",
    "7. Use your period checking function to test the values of theta for gamma=1.073, for t>30.  What are these values telling you about the graph?\n",
    "8. Plot theta for gamma=1.077 for t from 0 to 60. Interpret the motion of the pendulum.  Use the zoom tools to zoom in bottom of the oscillatory part of your graph.  Focus on times after t=30.  Describe what you see.\n",
    "9. Use your period checking function to test the values of theta for gamma=1.077, for t>30.  What are these values telling you about the graph?\n",
    "10. Now we want to see what happens if we change the initial conditions, without changing anything else.  Still using γ=1.077, set the initial conditions so that theta_0=-pi/2 and v_theta_0=0.  Plot both solutions on the same graph.  Make sure both plots are for γ=1.077.\n",
    "11. Using the new initial conditions, run through the period-doubling cascade using gamma=1.06, 1.078, 1.081, 1.0826.  Finally, try γ=1.105.  Convince yourself that this graph doesn’t repeat exactly.  This is an example of chaos."
